# React Project: Points of Interest on Local Map

This app displays a map with points of interest displayed as both markers and on a list; utilizing data local to the Big Island. The home of amazing poke and the super great bits.coop/#about <3

The list is filterable and the markers display data about a specific location; powered by the super Foursquare and Google Maps APIs.

## How To Start, Build, or Test

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Dependencies
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

This project uses Google Maps API, Foursquare API, runtime type checking for React props, and a whole lot of luck.

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

This app was built real-time in four different time zones. Iip Permana, Grace C (Support), Kelsey, and Brenda deserve much thanks for their feedback. Super thanks to Udacity and Google for the opportunity.
